## Neural Network Implementation

With fundamentals from past posts on the architecture of **neural networks**, evaluating predictive models, and a look into various activation functions, we can now bring all the elements together.

I'll be detailing a simple implementation of a 2-layer neural network in Python to toy around with.

```python
import numpy as np
```
