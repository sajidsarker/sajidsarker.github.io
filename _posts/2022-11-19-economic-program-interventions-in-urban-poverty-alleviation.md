## Economic Program Interventions in Urban Poverty Alleviation

**(This post is a work-in-progress).**

Previously in 2016, I was involved in conducting economic development research at the *Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies* (BIDS). It is an institute subordinate to the *Ministry of Planning* (Bangladesh) involved in academic research in the field of economics to provide policy-prescriptions and governmental economic planning.

One of the myriad projects I undertook in collaboration with DSK-Shiree (NGO) included a panel data study of urban populations in the capital of Dhaka existing at or below the national poverty line.

As an observational study of select households surveyed in a *randomised control trial* (RCT) spanning two rounds of the years 2011 and 2015, the goal of the program was to determine whether certain urban poverty alleviation economic interventions lead to anticipated positively associated outcomes for households.

The desired outcomes were for households to achieve socioeconomic growth and development across various indicators as a result of prescribed interventions applied across experimental groups, while withheld from a control group in 2011. The interventions associated with the best socioeconomic outcomes observed in 2015 were then applied to all households participating in the study as both ethical and humanitarian policy.

Controlled for:
- Exogenous Factors
- Time variant and invariant elements
- Heterogeneities between households
- Stratified sampling of impoverished urban population
