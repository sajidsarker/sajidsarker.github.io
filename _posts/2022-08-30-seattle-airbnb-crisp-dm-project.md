### Motivation

I utilise data regarding listings of properties by Airbnb hosts in the city of Seattle (WA) between 2016-2017 for data and regression analysis using the CRISP-DM process. I identify several questions of business interest which I attempt to answer through analysis of the available data.

### CRISP-DM

The CRISP-DM Process involves the following steps:

    Business Understanding
    Data Understanding
    Data Preparation
    Modelling
    Evaluation
    Deployment

### Business Understanding

On a preliminary review of the data schema, I am interested in finding some answers to the following questions:

1. What are the highest rated areas to to reserve accomodations in Seattle?
2. What are the highest revenue generating neighbourhoods in Seattle?
3. Which scores are most important to overall ratings? (Linear Regression)
4. Do hosts with higher ratings overall earn higher revenue? (Linear Regression)
5. What are the most widely provided amenities listed by hosts in Seattle?
6. Which amenities, housing characteristics, and factors contribute positively to revenue? (Linear Regression)
7. Which amenities, housing characteristics, and factors contribute positively to ratings? (Linear Regression)
