## Writers Gone Public, *Live from Prairie Lights*

[**Writers Gone Public reading, Live from Prairie Lights, December 4, 2014.**](https://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/islandora/object/ui%3Avwu_3653)

**(Navigate to 31:52 for my reading)**

During my undergraduate studies in Economics at the University of Iowa, I had participated in an event held at the famed Prairie Lights Bookshop where young writers from the non-fiction writing program were invited to read their works.

Though I was not in that program, my work was considered meritorious enough to warrant inclusion.

**Location:**
Prairie Lights (Iowa City, Iowa)
WSUI (Radio station: Iowa City, Iowa)
University of Iowa. Non-Fiction Writing Program

**Description:**
Join Prairie Lights and Director of the Undergraduate Nonfiction Writing Program Bonnie Sunstein in celebrating the semi-annual Writers Gone Public reading. The event features current undergraduate students who study with MFA Nonfiction faculty: Erick Brucker, Molly Coon, Chansi Long, Lucy Morris, Helen Rubinstein, Bernice Santiago, Beatrice Smigasiewicz, Josh Wheeler, and Rachel White. The students read excerpts from essays they wrote this semester.
