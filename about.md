Hi, I'm **Sajid Sarker**.

I'm a Data Scientist, Game Developer, and Writer.

I received my **M.A., Economics** from the *Department of Economics* at *The University of Washington* in Seattle, WA.

I received my **B.B.A., Economics** from the *Tippie College of Business* at the *University of Iowa* in Iowa City, IA.

From the age of 11, I've been a self-taught programmer. From the age of 15, I've been studying economics. From the age of 21, I've been learning econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My experiences as a researcher include conducting economic development research in Asia and the MENA region with various governmental and international governmental agencies.

## Why do you blog?

This blog contains my musings and misadventures on programming and artificial intelligence. From time to time, I'll be writing about things which interest me in the world of technology, programming, artificial intelligence, and open source.

Sometimes, I will be writing about writing as well, and share my thoughts and essays on eclectic interests which happen to catch my fancy in the moment.

I think expression is important and it adds to the heterogeneity of information on the internet. That is as long as how I think and feel is not too banal. To that end I'll strive to be as original as I can be with the utmost lack of effort as is marginally possible on my part.
